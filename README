# Description

When the application opens, a login window appears. The identification process requires battery percentage as password.

After login in, all notes were saved before will be decrypted and shown in the notes list screen.
At the bottom of the screen, there is a '+' button to create a new note.

Clicking on existing note/new note button will open the note screen and allow editing.
The changes will be updated in both notes list screen and re-encrypted to device memory.

Re- encrypting the whole data after every change will garentee strong detection, according to high frequency of key generation.
